# 🏨 AtliQ Hospitality Dashboard
Power BI Project – [Codebasics Resume Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenges/resume-project-challenge)
## 📖 Project Overview

- This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Challenge, where participants analyze and visualize the performance of AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels across India.

- Due to increasing competition and ineffective management decisions, AtliQ Grands faced a decline in revenue and market share.
To regain their market position, the management decided to adopt Business and Data Intelligence to drive better decision-making.

- As a Data Analyst, my task was to transform raw booking data into meaningful business insights using Power BI.

## 🎯 Business Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Develop insightful metrics for the revenue management team.

- Design a professional dashboard as per stakeholder mock-up.

- Derive additional insights not covered in the mock-up.
